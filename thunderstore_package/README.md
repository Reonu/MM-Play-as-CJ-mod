This mod lets you play as CJ in Majora's Mask

### Known issues
- CJ's right arm sometimes glitches out in first person.
- GetItem models might not always be aligned correctly.
- The Bunny Hood and Great Fairy Mask are too big.
- CJ is too tall for some cutscenes. The [No Letterboxing Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/No_Letterboxing/) is recommended to alleviate this somewhat.
  - This might be fixed in the future by making CJ crouch in cutscenes when standing still, just like he does now when playing the ocarina.

### Planned updates
- Sound
- Making Big Smoke optional and improving his skinning
